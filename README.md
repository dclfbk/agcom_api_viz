A web application to query the data of the television monitoring data of AGCOM

AGCOM periodically releases television monitoring data in XML format - https://www.agcom.it/dati-elementari-di-monitoraggio-televisivo
At present this data is exposed with a simple file and has no reuse.
The project aims to make this data more accessible through the creation of RestAPI and a web client that allows you to query them through visualizations.
